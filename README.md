A simple microblog that lets a user log in and out using previously generated user accounts.    Let a logged in user add new entries to a page consisting of a text-only title, and some HTML body text. This HTML wonâ€™t be sanitized, as this user is trusted.     Display all blog entries on the main page of the site, in reverse chronological order (newest on top).
